Exercise 1: Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers 
Given two integer numbers, write a Python program to return their product only if the product is equal to or lower than 1000. Otherwise, return their sum.

Given 1:

number1 = 20
number2 = 30
Expected Output:

The result is 600

Exercise 2: Print the Sum of a Current Number and a Previous number

Write Python code to iterate through the first 10 numbers and, in each iteration, print the sum of the current and previous number.

Output
Printing current and previous number sum in a range(10)
Current Number 0 Previous Number  0  Sum:  0
Current Number 1 Previous Number  0  Sum:  1
Current Number 2 Previous Number  1  Sum:  3
Current Number 3 Previous Number  2  Sum:  5
Current Number 4 Previous Number  3  Sum:  7
Current Number 5 Previous Number  4  Sum:  9
Current Number 6 Previous Number  5  Sum:  11
Current Number 7 Previous Number  6  Sum:  13
Current Number 8 Previous Number  7  Sum:  15
Current Number 9 Previous Number  8  Sum:  17


Exercise 3: Print characters present at an even index number

Write a Python code to accept a string from the user and display characters present at an even index number.

Orginal String is  PYnative
Printing only even index chars
P
n
t
v


Exercise 4: Remove first n characters from a string

Write a Python code to remove characters from a string from 0 to n and return a new string.


Exercise 5: Check if the first and last numbers of a list are the same
Write a code to return True if the list’s first and last numbers are the same. If the numbers are different, return False.


Exercise 6: Display numbers divisible by 5
Write a Python code to display numbers from a list divisible by 5


Exercise 7: Find the number of occurrences of a substring in a string
Write a Python code to find how often the substring “Emma” appears in the given string.


Exercise 8: Print the following pattern

1 
2 2 
3 3 3 
4 4 4 4 
5 5 5 5 5


Exercise 9: Check Palindrome Number
Write a Python code to check if the given number is a palindrome. A palindrome number reads the same forwards and backward. For example, 545 is a palindrome number.
original number 121
Yes. given number is palindrome number

original number 125
No. given number is not palindrome number


Exercise 10: Merge two lists using the following condition
Given two lists of numbers, write Python code to create a new list containing odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list.

Given:

list1 = [10, 20, 25, 30, 35]
list2 = [40, 45, 60, 75, 90]
Expected Output:

result list: [25, 35, 40, 60, 90]

Exercise 11: Generate Fibonacci series up to 15 terms
Have you ever wondered about the Fibonacci Sequence? It’s a series of numbers in which the next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. The first two numbers are 0 and 1.

For example, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. The next number in this series is 13 + 21 = 34.

Expected output:

Fibonacci sequence:
0  1  1  2  3  5  8  13  21  34  55  89  144  233  377
